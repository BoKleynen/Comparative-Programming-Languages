# Sless

## Extensibility

Briefly explain which files you have to change to introduce a new sless feature, e.g. add a new pseudo-class/-element, add support for namespaces, add at-rules, etc. 
Hint: if this lists all the files in your project you should reevaluate your implementation.

## Extra

Write which files, if any, contain extra self-written tests. If you did something extra impressive let us know here as well!

## Better Values

Explain your implementation briefly, if you chose to implement this extension.

## Improving original features

If you chose to extend some of the original features as an extensions, properly document what you did here.

NA.

## Custom Extension

If you came up with your own extension, properly document it here. Explain its
intended behavior and showcase by example.

- PropertyCounter: nothing to0 impressive here, but instead of only being able to count the occurrences of the `float` my
PropertyCounter can count arbitrary properties. 

## Feedback on the Project 

After working on this project for such a long time, you're allowed to vent in this
section. Tell us what you learned or what you would've liked to learn instead,
etc. This does not count toward your grades at all (neither positive nor negative).

I would have preferred a project in Rust. In part because I already know the language and wanted to do a bigger project
in it. I also believe that rust brings more new ideas (ownership, lifetime etc) to the table than scala which in my 
opinion has way too many ways in which you can write the same code. Although writing the implementation for a DSL was 
quite a fun activity.
